# Project Name
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company wants to know:

1.Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house

2.How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Business Goal :
1.Build a model with the available independent variables which will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.Using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
2.Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
3.They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
The model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
-Reading and Understanding the Data 
-Data cleaning  
-Data visualization
-Data preparation
-Train-Test splitting
-Model Building and Evaluation:Lasso and Ridge Regression

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Lasso helps in feature reduction as the coefficient value of one of the feature became 0.
-Based on Lasso features that can affect selecting the Sales price are Zoning classifications, Living area square feet, Overall quality and condition of the house, Foundation type of the house, Number of cars that can be accomodated in the garage, Total basement area in square feet and the Basement finished square feet area.
